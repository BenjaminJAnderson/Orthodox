// the point of this file is to be a sort of DSL for constructing keycaps.
// when you create a method chain you are just changing the parameters
// key.scad uses, it doesn't generate anything itself until the end. This
// lets it remain easy to use key.scad like before (except without key profiles)
// without having to rely on this file. Unfortunately that means setting tons of
// special variables, but that's a limitation of SCAD we have to work around
